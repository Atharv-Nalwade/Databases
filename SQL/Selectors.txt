DISTINCT
---->SELECT DISTINCT col1,col2  from tbl_name;
----> Returns only distinct values
----> its selects unique rows so if select distinct fname,lname from books then it returns only distinct rows with diff names or also it might happen that fname is same       and l name is diff 
----> IT COMES RIGHT AFTER SELECT.

ORDER BY
---> SELECT col1,col2 FROM books ORDER BY <a_field_in_tbl>
---> By default the orderinfg is in asecnding to make it descending use DESC after the field at end
---> Numbers come before words
---> we can select multiple columns and order them by any one of them select name,title,age from tbl order by age; === willd isplay all data which will be oredered by        age
---> select name,title,age from tbl order by 3;  === # stands for the 3rd paar i.e age here
---> select lname,fname from books order by lname,fname ---> this sorts the data by lname and if two lnames are same then the sorting is done by fname IMP


LIMIT
---> limits the number of results we see
---> select title from books limit 2 ---> show top2 title in  the order of insertion
---> use with order by
---> select title from books order by released_year desc limit 5;
---> limit is number of rows to be displayed while offset is number of rows to be skipped before starting the displaying part offset rows are first skipped then limit 
     starts acting
--->select title from books order by released_year limit 5 offset 1; here first order by happend then 1st row is skipped and next 5 are shown
---> to retrive all rows after a  certain offse4t we can use a very big number as 2nd para


LIKE
--->The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.
--->There are two wildcards often used in conjunction with the LIKE operator: 
--->The percent sign (%) represents zero, one, or multiple characters
---> The underscore sign (_) represents one, single character exactly one character  i.e "____" means something that has exactly 4 characher
-- % is anything or null while _ is excatly single 
---> "da%" means start with da and next can be anything
--->"%da%" is anything with da in between or end or just da
------> SELECT column1, column2, ...
         FROM table_name
         WHERE columnN LIKE pattern;
------> select author_fname from books where author_fname like "____"; show snames with exactly 4 char

----> to search something that has % or - in it use the \ 
----> Eg.  select title from books where title like "%\%%";  select anyhting followed by a % sign followed by anything i.e % sign in start,middle,end
            select title from books where title like "%\_%"; thats has underscore
