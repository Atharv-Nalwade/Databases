-- CHAR is used for fixed lengths 
--- we specify size while creating eg. char(5) truncates anyhting more than size 5

DECIMAL(x,y)
--- x is total max length of digites we can store and y is number of digits after decimal eg. decimal(5,2) is 999.99 5 in total and 2 after decimal
--- if we insert whole number then it will stored as dec=imal with y zeros after decimal point
--- storing more than x changes value and makes it max valuw of x digits fro 3 it woould be 99.9 and kind of
-- It rounds up

Decimal has more precison that float while float takes less space than decimal

DATE
-- YYYY/MM/DD

TIME
-- Stores time H/M/S 

DATETIME stores both date and time ---> Eg. insert into trying values ("24:12:19","2022-08-12","2022-08-12 20:12:19");

curdate() gives current date
curtime() gives current time
now() gives current datetime
