UNIQUE--

  The UNIQUE constraint ensures that all values in a column are different.

    Both the UNIQUE and PRIMARY KEY constraints provide a guarantee for uniqueness for a column or set of columns.

    A PRIMARY KEY constraint automatically has a UNIQUE constraint.

    However, you can have many UNIQUE constraints per table, but only one PRIMARY KEY constraint per table.
