COUNT
---> The COUNT() function returns the number of records returned by a select query.
--->Note: NULL values are not counted.
---> To count distinct entries we use COUNT( DISTINCT xyz)
---> SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT author_fname,author_lname) from books this tells us no .o fsitinct rows with distinct fname and lname

GROUP BY
----> Group by create group of all rows with same value of passed col_name into a single row eg. fow a db with studnets which took various subjects we can create group 
      of a particular subject i.e if combines all entries into a sinle row and if count applied on it show sthe number of entries into the single group
----> Group by groups based on rows which have sanme value of passed col_name
----> group by author_lname,author_fname groups rows where both author_lname and author_fname have same value
----> It aggregates or summarizes identical data into same row
----> COUNT(*) with grooup by shows how many rows have been grouped together

MIN AND MAX
----> SELECT MIN/MAX(column_name)  the condition is optional
      FROM table_name
      WHERE condition;
----> Select min(pages) from books;  selects min pages from table
----> select max(pages), title from books does not show us the books with max pages it gives wrong result;
----> One way of fixing this to do                    select * from books where pages=(select max(pages) from books);
----> Or to use order by limit 1
      
      
SUM
---->SELECT SUM(column_name)
     FROM table_name
     WHERE condition;
---->select author_fname,author_lname, sum(pages) as summed from books group by author_fname,author_lname;

AVG
---->SELECT AVG(column_name)
     FROM table_name
     WHERE condition;
