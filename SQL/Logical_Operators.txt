!=  NOT EQUAL is opposite of =

NOT LIKE is opposite of LIKE
SELECT * FROM books WHERE name not like "W%";  ---> select all books that do not start from W

Greater Than >
             >= equal too also
             
Less than <
          <= equal too also
          
          
AND = && gives only if both condition are true

OR = || 

BETWEEEN x AND y
---  Select tile from books where released_year BETWEEN 2004 AND 2005 ;
--- select title from books where released_year between 2001 and 2010;

NOT BETWEEN x and y

CAST( x AS data_type_desired) ---> converst one data type to another

IN
--- The IN operator allows you to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause.

--- The IN operator is a shorthand for multiple OR conditions.

--- SELECT column_name(s)
    FROM table_name
    WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2, ...);


NOT IN
--- Opposite of IN

% operator

---SELECT title, released_year FROM books
   WHERE released_year >= 2000
   AND released_year NOT IN 
   (2000,2002,2004,2006,2008,2010,2012,2014,2016);
 
   SELECT title, released_year FROM books
   WHERE released_year >= 2000 AND
   released_year % 2 != 0;



CASE

---   CASE
          WHEN condition1 THEN result1
          WHEN condition2 THEN result2
          WHEN conditionN THEN resultN
          ELSE result
      END;
      
 --- SELECT OrderID, Quantity,
      CASE
          WHEN Quantity > 30 THEN 'The quantity is greater than 30'
          WHEN Quantity = 30 THEN 'The quantity is 30'
          ELSE 'The quantity is under 30'
      END AS QuantityText
      FROM OrderDetails;     
      THEN is just deisplay that because its in select statement not after from
      
      select title,
       CASE
       WHEN released_year%2=0 THEN "EVEN"
       ELSE "ODD"
      END AS "ALIAS NAME"
       from books;
       
       
      SELECT author_fname, author_lname,
    CASE 
        WHEN COUNT(*) = 1 THEN '1 book'
        ELSE CONCAT(COUNT(*), ' books')
    END AS COUNT
FROM books 
GROUP BY author_lname, author_fname;
