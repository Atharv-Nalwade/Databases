SELECT col1,col2 FROM tabl_name;   ---> returns only specific col specified


SELECT name from tbl_name where name="xyz";
The WHERE clause is used to filter records.
It is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition
this is case insensitive

ALIASES
While displaying data if we want to display some column name as some other name then we use aliases;
eg. 
    SELECT name AS CAT_ID, breed from cats;   ---> here after displaying data the column name is shown as CAT_ID instead of name as in original specification while                                                          creating table
    
    for alias with a space 
    SELECT name AS "CATS NAME", breed FROM cats;


UPDATE
 TO update existing info in the table
 UPDATE <tbl_name> set <List of things which you want to modify or change> where <condition is matched>
Eg.     UPDATE cats SET breed="Changed" where age=14;

DELETE 
 to delete existing records from table
 DELETE FROM <tbl_name> where  condition
 Eg. DELTE FROM cats where name="xyz';
 
 ---->The WHERE clause specifies which record(s) should be deleted. If you omit the WHERE clause, all records in the table will be deleted!
      Eg. DELETE FROM cats;
          This will del all enr=tries from tha table the cats table exists with no records in it
